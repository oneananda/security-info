# How the Fix Works

[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] ensures only admins can access the /all endpoint.

Normal users are redirected or get 403 Forbidden if they try.

The /me endpoint uses the current user's ID from their token to return only their info.

## Best Practices

Always check user roles and ownership of resources.

Never rely on front-end hiding buttons or features as your only access control.

Log unauthorized attempts for audit purposes.
